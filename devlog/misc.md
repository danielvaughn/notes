For the stuff I do that doesn't neatly fit into a bucket.

Had the day off for Labor Day, decided to scaffold out a project in Astro.
Looking to use it for Stride, my big question was whether it easily lets you load client scripts.
It does, and is quite simple.
One issue is that I saw about 12 scripts getting loaded; I'm not sure whether it's due to the fact that I'm running in a dev environment.
