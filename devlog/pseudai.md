Built out the first version of the editor (renamed to Huzzah). Used NextJS13 on Vercel with an OpenAI integration.
The client side was built with Monaco.
It lets you (a) write some pseudocode, (b) select a language, and then (c) run it.
Long way to go to make it usable, but initial results promising.

Came up with an idea for a new AI editor that takes in pseudo code and spits out code in whatever language you prefer.
Working title is Pseudai but I was also thinking Huzzai or Huzzah.
