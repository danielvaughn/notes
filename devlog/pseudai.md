# Pseudai

I'm exploring a concept editor where you type pseudo code into an input panel, and see the equivalent in an output panel in whatever language you prefer.

Installed the Cursor editor and realized that it's essentially a built-in feature.
As a result, this idea is likely not going to be fruitful.

Built out the first version of the editor (renamed to Huzzah). Used NextJS13 on Vercel with an OpenAI integration.
The client side was built with Monaco.
It lets you (a) write some pseudocode, (b) select a language, and then (c) run it.
Long way to go to make it usable, but initial results promising.

Came up with an idea for a new AI editor that takes in pseudo code and spits out code in whatever language you prefer.
Working title is Pseudai but I was also thinking Huzzai or Huzzah.
