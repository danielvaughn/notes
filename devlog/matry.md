# 08.26.23

I created new nextjs project titled `interactive-docs`.
The goal is to create React-rendered examples of Matry.
At the root of the project is a file called `examples.matry` which contain the code samples.

At this point I'm torn between (a) using ANTLR to actually generate the output bundle, or (b) just building fake React renderings that mimic how Matry will work.
