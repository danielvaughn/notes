## Interaction

There are two primary modes of interaction - direct manipulation and indirect manipulation.
But this is a bit more complicated than it seems at face value.

Since "interaction" is composed of two things - input and output - each one can be independently direct or indirect.
So in other words you can have:

- Direct input: drawing on a digital canvas, drag and drop to upload a file
- Indirect input: toggling config options in a settings panel, writing code
- Direct output: UI
- Indirect output: code editor

## Manipulation

Another way to think about manipulation is that there are 3 core ways to "do things" with a computer:

1. Text Command: submitting live commands to a computer (cli)
2. Text Instruction: written commands that are executed at once, after they are written
3. Graphical Command: submitting live commands to a computer via a graphical user interface
