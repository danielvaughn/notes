## Unix philosophy

- invented by bell labs in the 70s
- unix is a philosophy
- instead of large specialized programs, prefer fewer composable tools
- each program should do one thing and do it well
- this is where pipes and streams come from

- mac uses bsd, linux uses...well, linux
- lots of other OS's are based on unix, so they're "unix-like" systems, even though they share none of the actual codebase
- linux is not directly unix

## Why Linux?

- it's free, open source
- it runs everywhere: x86, amd, phones, fridges, cars, etc
- it's been around _forever_ so very stable and lots and lots of resources
- it's technically predictable and stable

## Distros

- what's the diff between redhat/ubuntu/arch/etc? they all share a kernel but build other stuff around that kernel
- debian is one of the older distros, lots of distros are based on it (like ubuntu)
